# secure_dll_loader
this is a library so you can build your own secure dll loader

## how do i use this?
firstly, this is not a friendly library for those who are new to coding.
you'll need to make the loader in a dll form, the main exe file downloads the dll bytes from the server and injects it into its own process.

##features
- ssl communication
- debug console
- compile-time and run-time string encryption
- injection library
- json
